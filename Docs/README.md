# Inventory Demand Forecasting

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast inventory demand for Grupo Bimbo, ensuring a steady supply of over 100 bakery products across 1 million stores along its 45,000 routes throughout Mexico. By achieving precise forecasts, we aim to minimize the surplus, reduce the amount spent on refunds to store owners for unsold products, and ensure that consumers are not greeted with empty shelves.

## Action Plan
1. **Data Collection and Understanding**: Acquire historical sales data and understand the underlying patterns and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data to remove any inconsistencies, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the data to gain insights and identify the features that can help in predicting the inventory demand.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that can improve the predictive power of the model.
5. **Model Building**: Train various machine learning models to find the one that performs the best.
6. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and tune the hyperparameters to improve the performance.
7. **Deployment**: Deploy the model to a production environment where it can start taking in new data and making predictions.

## Machine Learning Models
### 3.a Linear Regression
   - A simple yet effective model to establish the linear relationships between the features and the target variable.
### 3.b Decision Trees
   - Capable of capturing complex relationships in the data by dividing the dataset into subsets based on the values of input features.
### 3.c Random Forest
   - An ensemble method that can capture the non-linear relationships in the data and provide a robust prediction by averaging the predictions of multiple decision trees.

## Conclusion
The project successfully delivers a model capable of forecasting the inventory demand for Grupo Bimbo with a reasonable level of accuracy. The insights derived from this project are instrumental in optimizing the supply chain operations, reducing wastage, and improving customer satisfaction by ensuring the availability of products.

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. **Incorporate Additional Data**: Incorporating additional data such as holiday schedules, store promotions, or local events can potentially improve the model's accuracy.
2. **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Experimenting with more advanced machine learning models or deep learning approaches might yield better results.
3. **Feature Selection and Engineering**: Further analysis could be done to identify the most significant features and engineer new features that could improve the model's performance.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: More extensive hyperparameter tuning can be performed to squeeze out better performance from the models.
5. **Real-time Data Analysis**: Implementing a real-time data analysis and forecasting system can help in making more timely decisions and adjustments to the inventory levels.
